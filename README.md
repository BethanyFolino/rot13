# Rot13
Rot13 is a Python program that encodes input text with the Caesar Cipher, which rotates characters
13 spaces ahead in the alphabet. It also decodes text encoded with the Caesar Cipher. I made this 
program as part of Kenzie Academy's software engineering program.

# Usage Examples
# To encode:
```python
python rot13.py "hello"
uryyb
```
# To decode:
```python
python rot13.py "uryyb"
hello
```
# Mixed case:
```python
python rot13.py "hEllO"
uRyyB
```
